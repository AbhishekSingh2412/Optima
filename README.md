# OPTIMA

## Project Description

1. Optima is a flutter application that aims to boost community cooperation by ensuring people only head to local grocery stores/ kirana shops when the product they need is present in the store. 

2. While avoiding unnecessary accumulation of people, the app allows people to sign up to a local shop, place orders for items in stock and also indicate the shop owner(seller) about items they want that aren’t in stock. 

3. The customers have a clear understanding of what items the local shop has and thus will only step out if what they need exists. 

4. The seller is indicated about the demands of all these items, the ones in his shop and the ones that people want but aren't in his shop. 

5. Further using machine learning algorithms, we study the requirements of people in a locality and suggest what items the shop owner should subscribe to or get more of. 

6. The experience for the customer is bundled with the wonders of the IBM Watson Chatbot. 
Further both the customer and the shop owner can use the IBM Visual Recognition tool to add items to their list/inventory respectively. 

#### Everyone benefits from this free application as while the customer remains safe at home and seamlessly uses Optima for his/her shopping needs, the shop owner gets free analytics that could boost sales and help them benefit in these tough times, while being able to monitor the customer’s requirements.
